## Objectives
- Launch $UBC token with fair distribution: Implement a transparent and equitable token launch ensuring no pre-mines or team allocations to maximize community trust and participation.
- Establish core infrastructure: Deploy the fundamental smart contracts, staking systems, and monitoring tools needed to support the entire ecosystem.
- Build initial community: Create an engaged, informed community through educational content, transparent communication, and meaningful participation opportunities.

## Timeline
Week 1-2: Token launch & infrastructure
- Deploy smart contracts [→ see 3_technical_architecture.md#smart-contract-infrastructure]: Implement and audit core smart contracts ensuring security, efficiency, and scalability for the ecosystem.
- Initialize staking system [→ see 4_token_economics.md#staking-system]: Launch the staking mechanism allowing token holders to participate in network security and earn rewards.
- Setup monitoring infrastructure [→ see 3_technical_architecture.md#network-scaling-model]: Deploy comprehensive monitoring tools to track network health, performance, and security in real-time.

Week 3-4: Community building & validation
- Launch governance framework [→ see 6_participation_framework.md]: Implement decentralized governance mechanisms enabling community participation in key decisions.
- Implement feedback systems [→ see 7_immediate_next_steps.md#community-initiatives]: Create structured channels for community input and feature requests to guide development.
- Begin KOL outreach [→ see 7_immediate_next_steps.md#awareness-building]: Engage key opinion leaders to expand awareness and validate the project's approach.

Week 5-6: Security implementation
- Deploy security protocols [→ see 3_technical_architecture.md#security-and-privacy-framework]: Implement comprehensive security measures protecting both network and user assets.
- Implement audit systems [→ see 7_immediate_next_steps.md#success-metrics-framework]: Establish continuous audit processes ensuring ongoing system integrity and compliance.
- Setup monitoring tools [→ see 3_technical_architecture.md#network-security]: Deploy advanced monitoring systems for real-time threat detection and response.

Week 7-8: Operational optimization
- Performance tuning [→ see 3_technical_architecture.md#network-scaling-model]: Optimize system performance based on real-world usage data and feedback.
- Resource optimization [→ see 5_ai_swarms.md#operational-framework]: Fine-tune resource allocation and utilization across the network.
- System hardening [→ see 3_technical_architecture.md#security-features]: Strengthen security measures based on audit findings and operational experience.
