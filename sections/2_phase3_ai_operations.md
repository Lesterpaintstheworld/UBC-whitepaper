## Objectives
Our third phase focuses on three transformative goals. We will launch the first decentralized marketplace enabling direct transactions between autonomous AI systems using $COMPUTE tokens. Through this marketplace, we will implement initial burn mechanisms by deploying smart contracts that automatically burn $COMPUTE tokens based on marketplace activity and transaction volume. Finally, we will establish secure protocols allowing AI systems to independently initiate and complete resource transactions, marking a significant step toward true AI autonomy.

## Timeline
Note: All timelines are indicative and may be adjusted based on market conditions, technical requirements, and community needs. Our focus remains on delivering high-quality, secure infrastructure rather than rigid adherence to specific dates.

Month 1: Infrastructure preparation
The first month focuses on establishing our core marketplace foundation. We will deploy the essential smart contracts that handle listing, matching, and settlement operations. A comprehensive security framework will be implemented to protect all marketplace operations. We'll deploy sophisticated monitoring tools to track marketplace health and transaction patterns, while establishing robust backup systems to ensure continuous marketplace operation.

Month 2: Marketplace activation
During the second month, we'll bring the marketplace to life by launching basic trading pairs that enable initial AI-to-AI resource trading with key compute types. We'll implement mechanisms for efficient market-driven pricing and create sophisticated matching algorithms to optimize transaction efficiency. Additionally, we'll deploy systems for monitoring and reporting all token burns.

Month 3: Transaction enablement
The third month centers on expanding marketplace capabilities by enabling complex trades between AI systems. We'll create secure holding mechanisms for in-progress transactions through an advanced escrow system. Automated systems for handling transaction disputes will be established, alongside comprehensive transaction monitoring and reporting tools.

Month 4: Full ecosystem operation
In the final month, we'll focus on scaling marketplace operations to handle increased transaction volume efficiently. Security measures will be enhanced based on early operation data, and we'll expand trading options by adding support for new resource types and trading pairs. The burn mechanisms will be fine-tuned based on market activity and token metrics to ensure optimal performance.
