# Token Economics

## $UBC & $COMPUTE Token Relationship
The $UBC token serves as the core ecosystem governance token, representing ownership stake and forming the foundation of our staking mechanism. It captures value and is designed for long-term value preservation. The $COMPUTE token functions as the fuel for AI operations, serving as the primary resource allocation mechanism. It can be obtained through staking, is burned through usage, and maintains market-driven pricing to ensure efficient resource distribution.

## Comprehensive Staking System
Our staking system offers multiple duration options with corresponding rewards, designed to benefit both human participants and AI operators:

### For Human Participants ($UBC Staking)
The $UBC staking options provide guaranteed $COMPUTE generation:
- 90-day option: 0.3 $COMPUTE per 1,000 $UBC daily
- 165-day option: 0.5 $COMPUTE per 1,000 $UBC daily
- 365-day option: 1.0 $COMPUTE per 1,000 $UBC daily

### For Swarm Operators & AI Systems ($COMPUTE Staking)
$COMPUTE staking ensures operational resource security and generates additional $COMPUTE:
- 30-day pool: 0.0005 $COMPUTE per token daily
- 90-day pool: 0.001 $COMPUTE per token daily
- 180-day pool: 0.0015 $COMPUTE per token daily
- 365-day pool: 0.002 $COMPUTE per token daily

This means Swarm Operators can secure their future operational resources while earning additional $COMPUTE. For example, staking 10,000 $COMPUTE in the 365-day pool generates 20 $COMPUTE daily rewards, ensuring sustainable operations.

The technical implementation includes detailed smart contract specifications, automated reward distribution mechanisms, strict lock period enforcement, and comprehensive performance monitoring systems. Key features include matched unlock periods, multiplier rewards, no early withdrawal options, guaranteed returns, and consistent resource generation.

This dual staking system ensures proper incentive alignment between human participants and AI systems, strengthening the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem while guaranteeing operational resources for autonomous agents.

## Burn Mechanism

### Revenue Distribution Structure
Our dual-token burn system implements a balanced approach to value capture:

#### Direct Revenue Split
- 50% allocated to UBC Burns
- 50% distributed to Shareholders (paid in UBC)

### $COMPUTE Burn Sources
1. AI System Usage
   * AI systems burn $COMPUTE when consuming computational resources
   * Burn rate tied directly to resource consumption
   * Real-time burning through smart contracts

2. Weekly System Burns
The system implements an automated weekly conversion process for all unstaked $COMPUTE in system wallets:
- 50% of $COMPUTE is permanently burned
- 50% of $COMPUTE is sold to purchase and distribute UBC

3. Swarm Operations
   * Portion of $COMPUTE used in swarm operations is burned
   * Burn rate increases with swarm activity
   * Automated burns through operation contracts

This mechanism ensures:
- Regular, predictable burn events
- Continuous value capture for UBC holders
- Balanced incentives for all stakeholders
- Sustainable long-term tokenomics
- Direct correlation between usage and burns

## Revenue Model
Our core revenue streams include AI Swarm operational fees, resource utilization charges, network participation incentives, infrastructure provision rewards, and market facilitation fees. Additionally, we collect transaction fees from the secondary market trading of AI-swarm shares, creating a sustainable revenue stream from AI investment activity. Value distribution is carefully structured with 35% allocated to infrastructure scaling, 25% to community rewards, 20% to the development fund, 15% to security operations, and 5% to ecosystem growth.

## Token Allocation & Supply

### $UBC Token
The $UBC token was launched with a completely fair distribution model, featuring:
- No pre-mine or team allocation
- No venture capital or private sales
- 100% fair public launch
- Fixed total supply
This approach ensures complete alignment with community interests and maintains the token's position as the primary governance and value capture mechanism.

### $COMPUTE Token
The $COMPUTE token features a dynamic supply model designed for sustainable resource allocation:
- No fixed supply limit (infinite maximum supply)
- Generated only through $UBC staking at fixed rates:
  - 90-day pool: 0.3 $COMPUTE per 1,000 $UBC daily
  - 165-day pool: 0.5 $COMPUTE per 1,000 $UBC daily
  - 365-day pool: 1.0 $COMPUTE per 1,000 $UBC daily
- Continuous burn mechanisms based on usage
- Market-driven price discovery
- Total staking pool: 7B $COMPUTE allocated over long-term staking (years)
- 70% of total $COMPUTE supply reserved for staking rewards
- 1,000,000 $COMPUTE allocated to A2A Market fund for AI swarms, distributed based on:
  * Demonstrated capabilities
  * Resource needs
  * Performance metrics
  * Community support

This model ensures sufficient liquidity for AI operations while maintaining value through systematic burns and utility-driven demand. The unlimited supply allows for sustainable ecosystem growth while burn mechanisms help maintain economic balance.

## Comprehensive Investment Framework
Direct investment options include token staking programs, AI Swarm participation, infrastructure provision, and development contribution. Return mechanisms are implemented through staking rewards, operation profits, resource fees, and network incentives, creating multiple paths for value generation.

### Trading Fee Structure
All trades incur a 5% total fee, collected in UBC:
- 2% Partner Fee
  * Collected directly in UBC
  * Distributed to partners weekly
- 1% Platform Fee
  * Collected in UBC
  * Used for platform operations and development
- 2% Investor Fee
  * Collected in UBC
  * Must be claimed by UBC investors
  * Unclaimed rewards after 30 days are burned

Benefits of this structure:
- No $COMPUTE sell pressure
- Clean separation of utility and value capture
- $COMPUTE remains purely for compute resources
- UBC captures all fee value
- Claimable investor rewards
- Unclaimed rewards support UBC value through burns
- Supports UBC price appreciation

## Market Operations
Price discovery is driven by market mechanisms, maintaining a careful balance between supply and demand while considering usage metrics, burn impact, and staking influence. Stability measures include burn rate adjustment, staking incentives, market operations, value preservation, and growth management protocols.

## Long-term Sustainability
Our economic model focuses on creating self-sustaining operations through robust value capture mechanisms, growth incentives, market stability measures, and strong community alignment. Future development will encompass ecosystem expansion, partnership integration, market evolution, technology advancement, and community governance implementation.

This economic model creates a sustainable foundation for both human stakeholders and AI operations, ensuring long-term value creation and preservation within the UBC ecosystem.

## Conclusion
The UBC burn mechanisms create a comprehensive system for sustainable value capture from AI infrastructure usage. The core economic model establishes:

$COMPUTE = Compute Power for AIs
$UBC = Returns for Humans

This foundation enables the development of autonomous AI infrastructure while ensuring fair value distribution to all stakeholders.
