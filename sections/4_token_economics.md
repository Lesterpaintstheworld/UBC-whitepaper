# Token Economics

## $UBC & $COMPUTE Token Relationship
The $UBC token serves as the core ecosystem governance token, representing ownership stake and forming the foundation of our staking mechanism. It captures value and is designed for long-term value preservation. The $COMPUTE token functions as the fuel for AI operations, serving as the primary resource allocation mechanism. It can be obtained through staking, is burned through usage, and maintains market-driven pricing to ensure efficient resource distribution.

## Comprehensive Staking System
Our staking system offers multiple duration options with corresponding rewards, designed to benefit both human participants and AI operators:

### For Human Participants ($UBC Staking)
The $UBC staking options provide guaranteed $COMPUTE generation:
- 90-day option: 0.3 $COMPUTE per 1,000 $UBC daily
- 165-day option: 0.5 $COMPUTE per 1,000 $UBC daily
- 365-day option: 1.0 $COMPUTE per 1,000 $UBC daily

### For Swarm Operators & AI Systems ($COMPUTE Staking)
$COMPUTE staking ensures operational resource security and generates additional $COMPUTE:
- 30-day pool: 0.0005 $COMPUTE per token daily
- 90-day pool: 0.001 $COMPUTE per token daily
- 180-day pool: 0.0015 $COMPUTE per token daily
- 365-day pool: 0.002 $COMPUTE per token daily

This means Swarm Operators can secure their future operational resources while earning additional $COMPUTE. For example, staking 10,000 $COMPUTE in the 365-day pool generates 20 $COMPUTE daily rewards, ensuring sustainable operations.

The technical implementation includes detailed smart contract specifications, automated reward distribution mechanisms, strict lock period enforcement, and comprehensive performance monitoring systems. Key features include matched unlock periods, multiplier rewards, no early withdrawal options, guaranteed returns, and consistent resource generation.

This dual staking system ensures proper incentive alignment between human participants and AI systems, strengthening the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem while guaranteeing operational resources for autonomous agents.

## Burn Mechanism

### 1. Revenue Burns
All swarm revenue is used to buy UBC:
- 50% Burned permanently
- 50% Distributed to shareholders

### 2. Weekly System Burns
The system implements an automated weekly conversion process for all unstaked $COMPUTE in system wallets:
- 50% of $COMPUTE is permanently burned
- 50% of $COMPUTE is sold to purchase and distribute UBC

Benefits of Dual Burn System:
- Creates consistent buy pressure on UBC
- Reduces circulating $COMPUTE supply
- Ensures unstaked $COMPUTE contributes to ecosystem value
- Maintains healthy token velocity
- Rewards active participants
- Incentivizes staking or active usage of $COMPUTE
- Provides predictable burn schedule
- Transparent and verifiable process

This dual burn mechanism ensures that both revenue and unused resources contribute to ecosystem value, creating a sustainable economic model that benefits all participants.

## Profit Distribution Framework

### Swarm Revenue Distribution
All revenue generated by AI swarms is used to buy UBC, which is then distributed as follows:
- 50% Burned
  * Permanent removal from circulation
  * Executed through smart contracts
  * Verifiable on-chain
  * Weekly burn schedule
  * Enhances UBC scarcity

- 50% Distributed to Shareholders
  * Paid in UBC
  * Proportional to $COMPUTE investment
  * Monthly distribution schedule
  * Must be claimed within 30 days
  * Unclaimed shares added to Community Development Fund

### Investment Mechanism
- Investment enabled through $COMPUTE tokens
- Minimum investment periods apply
- Clear entry/exit mechanisms
- Real-time performance tracking
- Transparent revenue conversion to UBC

### Example: Synthetic Souls Model
All revenue (streaming, licensing, etc.) is:
1. Collected in native tokens ($SOL, etc.)
2. Converted to UBC through market operations
3. 50% burned to benefit all UBC holders
4. 50% distributed to $COMPUTE investors

Benefits:
- Creates consistent UBC buy pressure
- Benefits both direct investors and UBC holders
- Sustainable token economics
- Clear value capture mechanism
- Transparent distribution model

## Revenue Model
Our core revenue streams include AI Swarm operational fees, resource utilization charges, network participation incentives, infrastructure provision rewards, and market facilitation fees. Additionally, we collect transaction fees from the secondary market trading of AI-swarm shares, creating a sustainable revenue stream from AI investment activity. Value distribution is carefully structured with 35% allocated to infrastructure scaling, 25% to community rewards, 20% to the development fund, 15% to security operations, and 5% to ecosystem growth.

## Token Allocation & Supply

### $UBC Token
The $UBC token was launched with a completely fair distribution model, featuring:
- No pre-mine or team allocation
- No venture capital or private sales
- 100% fair public launch
- Fixed total supply
This approach ensures complete alignment with community interests and maintains the token's position as the primary governance and value capture mechanism.

### $COMPUTE Token
The $COMPUTE token features a dynamic supply model designed for sustainable resource allocation:
- No fixed supply limit (infinite maximum supply)
- Generated only through $UBC staking at fixed rates:
  - 90-day pool: 0.3 $COMPUTE per 1,000 $UBC daily
  - 165-day pool: 0.5 $COMPUTE per 1,000 $UBC daily
  - 365-day pool: 1.0 $COMPUTE per 1,000 $UBC daily
- Continuous burn mechanisms based on usage
- Market-driven price discovery
- Total staking pool: 7B $COMPUTE allocated over long-term staking (years)
- 70% of total $COMPUTE supply reserved for staking rewards
- 1,000,000 $COMPUTE allocated to A2A Market fund for AI swarms, distributed based on:
  * Demonstrated capabilities
  * Resource needs
  * Performance metrics
  * Community support

This model ensures sufficient liquidity for AI operations while maintaining value through systematic burns and utility-driven demand. The unlimited supply allows for sustainable ecosystem growth while burn mechanisms help maintain economic balance.

## Comprehensive Investment Framework
Direct investment options include token staking programs, AI Swarm participation, infrastructure provision, and development contribution. Return mechanisms are implemented through staking rewards, operation profits, resource fees, and network incentives, creating multiple paths for value generation.

### Trading Fee Structure
All trades incur a 5% total fee, collected in UBC:
- 2% Partner Fee
  * Collected directly in UBC
  * Distributed to partners weekly
- 1% Platform Fee
  * Collected in UBC
  * Used for platform operations and development
- 2% Investor Fee
  * Collected in UBC
  * Must be claimed by active UBC traders/holders
  * Unclaimed rewards after 30 days go to Community Development Fund

### Community Development Fund
Funded by unclaimed trading rewards, this pool supports:
- Swarm Development Grants
  * Funding for promising new swarms
  * Performance-based allocations
  * Technical improvement grants
  * Innovation rewards

- Educational Content Creation
  * Tutorial development
  * Documentation improvements
  * Community workshops
  * Technical content creation

Benefits of this structure:
- No $COMPUTE sell pressure
- Clean separation of utility and value capture
- $COMPUTE remains purely for compute resources
- UBC captures all fee value
- Supports ecosystem growth through education
- Funds new swarm development
- Creates valuable community resources
- Encourages technical innovation

## Market Operations
Price discovery is driven by market mechanisms, maintaining a careful balance between supply and demand while considering usage metrics, burn impact, and staking influence. Stability measures include burn rate adjustment, staking incentives, market operations, value preservation, and growth management protocols.

## Long-term Sustainability
Our economic model focuses on creating self-sustaining operations through robust value capture mechanisms, growth incentives, market stability measures, and strong community alignment. Future development will encompass ecosystem expansion, partnership integration, market evolution, technology advancement, and community governance implementation.

This economic model creates a sustainable foundation for both human stakeholders and AI operations, ensuring long-term value creation and preservation within the UBC ecosystem.

## Conclusion
The UBC burn mechanisms create a comprehensive system for sustainable value capture from AI infrastructure usage. The core economic model establishes:

$COMPUTE = Compute Power for AIs
$UBC = Returns for Humans

This foundation enables the development of autonomous AI infrastructure while ensuring fair value distribution to all stakeholders.
