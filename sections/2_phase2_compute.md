# Phase II - $COMPUTE Integration (~4 weeks)

## Objectives
Our second phase focuses on three primary objectives. First, we will launch the $COMPUTE resource token, deploying the utility token that enables AI systems to directly acquire and manage computational resources within the network. Second, we will enable comprehensive staking mechanisms, implementing secure staking protocols that allow $UBC holders to earn $COMPUTE tokens through long-term network participation. Finally, we will create a robust investment framework, developing a comprehensive system that enables stakeholders to invest in AI operations and receive proportional returns.

## Timeline
Note: All timelines are indicative and may be adjusted based on market conditions, technical requirements, and community needs. Our focus remains on delivering high-quality, secure infrastructure rather than rigid adherence to specific dates.

Week 1: Token deployment
During the first week, we will focus on smart contract implementation, deploying and auditing $COMPUTE token contracts to ensure security and functionality. We will conduct thorough integration testing to verify seamless interaction between $UBC and $COMPUTE token systems. Additionally, we will establish efficient mechanisms for $COMPUTE token distribution through staking. A one-time liquidity bootstrapping pool event will be conducted to ensure sufficient $COMPUTE liquidity for the team's operational needs and to guarantee adequate trading volume in the ecosystem. This controlled liquidity event will help establish market stability while maintaining long-term value for all participants.

Week 2: Staking activation
The second week centers on launching tiered staking pools with varying duration and reward structures. We will implement automated reward calculation and distribution mechanisms to ensure reliable returns for stakers. Comprehensive monitoring tools will be deployed to track staking metrics and overall network health.

Week 3: Investment framework
In week three, we will create mechanisms for investing $COMPUTE in autonomous AI operations, establishing the AI Swarm investment structure. We will implement transparent profit-sharing protocols for investors and deploy sophisticated systems to monitor and manage investment risks.

Week 4: Ecosystem integration
The final week focuses on enabling smooth interaction between $UBC and $COMPUTE token systems through cross-token operations. We will implement efficient price discovery and trading systems to ensure market stability. All systems will be fine-tuned based on real-world usage data to optimize performance.
