# Phase II - $COMPUTE Integration (~4 weeks)

## Objectives
Our second phase focuses on three primary objectives. First, we will launch the $COMPUTE resource token, deploying the utility token that enables AI systems to directly acquire and manage computational resources within the network. Second, we will enable comprehensive staking mechanisms, implementing secure staking protocols that allow $UBC holders to earn $COMPUTE tokens through long-term network participation. Finally, we will create a robust investment framework, developing a comprehensive system that enables stakeholders to invest in AI operations and receive proportional returns.
