## Objectives
- Launch $COMPUTE resource token: Deploy the utility token that enables AI systems to directly acquire and manage computational resources within the network.
- Enable staking mechanisms: Implement secure staking protocols allowing $UBC holders to earn $COMPUTE tokens through long-term network participation.
- Create investment framework: Develop a comprehensive system enabling stakeholders to invest in AI operations and receive proportional returns.

## Timeline
Week 1: Token deployment
- Smart contract implementation: Deploy and audit $COMPUTE token contracts ensuring security and functionality.
- Integration testing: Verify seamless interaction between $UBC and $COMPUTE token systems.
- Distribution framework: Establish efficient mechanisms for $COMPUTE token distribution through staking.

Week 2: Staking activation
- Staking pool initialization: Launch tiered staking pools with varying duration and reward structures.
- Reward distribution system: Implement automated reward calculation and distribution mechanisms.
- Monitoring tools: Deploy systems to track staking metrics and network health.

Week 3: Investment framework
- AI Swarm investment structure: Create mechanisms for investing $COMPUTE in autonomous AI operations.
- Return distribution system: Implement transparent profit-sharing protocols for investors.
- Risk management tools: Deploy systems to monitor and manage investment risks.

Week 4: Ecosystem integration
- Cross-token operations: Enable smooth interaction between $UBC and $COMPUTE token systems.
- Market mechanisms: Implement efficient price discovery and trading systems.
- Performance optimization: Fine-tune all systems based on real-world usage data.
