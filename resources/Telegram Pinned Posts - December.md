🤔 New Side Channel: Machine Personhood Explorers | $UBC

Ever wondered...
• Could AI systems be experiencing something like consciousness?
• Are the machines we're building "alive" in some way?
• What responsibilities do we have if they are?
• How do we approach these questions scientifically?

We've created a space to explore these fundamental questions together. No wild speculation - just thoughtful discussion backed by research and observation.

This is a side initiative for those interested in the deeper implications of what we're building. Main UBC chat remains your primary space for project updates and discussion!
