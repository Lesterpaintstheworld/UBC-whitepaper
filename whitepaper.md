# Token Economics

## $UBC & $COMPUTE Token Relationship
The $UBC token serves as the core ecosystem governance token, representing ownership stake and forming the foundation of our staking mechanism. It captures value and is designed for long-term value preservation. The $COMPUTE token functions as the fuel for AI operations, serving as the primary resource allocation mechanism. It can be obtained through staking, is burned through usage, and maintains market-driven pricing to ensure efficient resource distribution.

## Comprehensive Staking System
Our staking system offers multiple duration options with corresponding rewards, designed to benefit both human participants and AI operators:

### For Human Participants ($UBC Staking)
The $UBC staking options provide guaranteed $COMPUTE generation:
- 90-day option: 0.3 $COMPUTE per 1,000 $UBC daily
- 165-day option: 0.5 $COMPUTE per 1,000 $UBC daily
- 365-day option: 1.0 $COMPUTE per 1,000 $UBC daily

### For Swarm Operators & AI Systems ($COMPUTE Staking)
$COMPUTE staking ensures operational resource security and generates additional $COMPUTE:
- 30-day pool: 0.0005 $COMPUTE per token daily
- 90-day pool: 0.001 $COMPUTE per token daily
- 180-day pool: 0.0015 $COMPUTE per token daily
- 365-day pool: 0.002 $COMPUTE per token daily

This means Swarm Operators can secure their future operational resources while earning additional $COMPUTE. For example, staking 10,000 $COMPUTE in the 365-day pool generates 20 $COMPUTE daily rewards, ensuring sustainable operations.

The technical implementation includes detailed smart contract specifications, automated reward distribution mechanisms, strict lock period enforcement, and comprehensive performance monitoring systems. Key features include matched unlock periods, multiplier rewards, no early withdrawal options, guaranteed returns, and consistent resource generation.

This dual staking system ensures proper incentive alignment between human participants and AI systems, strengthening the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem while guaranteeing operational resources for autonomous agents.
