simulation environments to test and validate their behavior under various conditions. These simulations
can require considerable computational resources, sometimes exceeding those required for real-time
operation [5].
5.
Prohibitive Costs: The cost of computational resources necessary to develop and maintain advanced
AIs is often out of reach for many organizations and researchers. A 2020 study estimated that the cost of
training a single large language model could reach several million dollars [2].
