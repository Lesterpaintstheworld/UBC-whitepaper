# Universal Basic Compute (UBC) Whitepaper

[ðŸ“„ Download PDF Version](ubc_whitepaper.pdf)

## Overview
This repository contains the official UBC whitepaper - a living, breathing document that evolves with our project and community. Rather than a static PDF, we've chosen to maintain our whitepaper in an open, version-controlled format to ensure maximum transparency and enable community participation.

## Living Document Philosophy
We believe a whitepaper should be more than a snapshot in time. Our approach enables:
- Continuous refinement and updates as the project evolves
- Complete transparency through visible commit history
- Community participation in document development
- Clear tracking of changes and improvements
- Access to all historical versions
- Real-time updates reflecting project progress
