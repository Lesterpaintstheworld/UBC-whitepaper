## $UBC & $COMPUTE Token Relationship
The $UBC token serves as the core ecosystem governance token, representing ownership stake and forming the foundation of our staking mechanism. It captures value and is designed for long-term value preservation. The $COMPUTE token functions as the fuel for AI operations, serving as the primary resource allocation mechanism. It can be obtained through staking, is burned through usage, and maintains market-driven pricing to ensure efficient resource distribution.

## Comprehensive Staking System
Our staking system offers multiple duration options with corresponding rewards. The 90-day option provides 0.3 $COMPUTE per 1,000 $UBC daily, while the 165-day option increases to 0.5 $COMPUTE, and the 365-day option maximizes returns at 1.0 $COMPUTE. The technical implementation includes detailed smart contract specifications, automated reward distribution mechanisms, strict lock period enforcement, and comprehensive performance monitoring systems. Key features include matched unlock periods, multiplier rewards, no early withdrawal options, guaranteed returns, and consistent resource generation.

## Burn Mechanism
Our implementation strategy begins with automated marketplace burns in Phase III, followed by accelerated network expansion burns in Phase IV. The system includes usage-based burn triggers with volume adjustments, real-time transparency reporting, and long-term value preservation mechanisms. The technical framework encompasses smart contract automation, market impact monitoring, volume milestone tracking, stability maintenance, and sustainability measures. The burn schedule is divided between Phase III, which focuses on initial marketplace activation burns, transaction-based automatic burns, and volume-based rate adjustments, and Phase IV, which implements provider integration milestone burns, network expansion acceleration, and market equilibrium targeting.

## Revenue Model
Our core revenue streams include AI Swarm operational fees, resource utilization charges, network participation incentives, infrastructure provision rewards, and market facilitation fees. Additionally, we collect transaction fees from the secondary market trading of AI-swarm shares, creating a sustainable revenue stream from AI investment activity. Value distribution is carefully structured with 35% allocated to infrastructure scaling, 25% to community rewards, 20% to the development fund, 15% to security operations, and 5% to ecosystem growth.

## Token Allocation & Supply

### $UBC Token
The $UBC token was launched with a completely fair distribution model, featuring:
- No pre-mine or team allocation
- No venture capital or private sales
- 100% fair public launch
- Fixed total supply
This approach ensures complete alignment with community interests and maintains the token's position as the primary governance and value capture mechanism.

### $COMPUTE Token
The $COMPUTE token features a dynamic supply model designed for sustainable resource allocation:
- No fixed supply limit
- Generated only through $UBC staking
- Continuous burn mechanisms based on usage
- Market-driven price discovery
This model ensures sufficient liquidity for AI operations while maintaining value through systematic burns and utility-driven demand.

## Comprehensive Investment Framework
Direct investment options include token staking programs, AI Swarm participation, infrastructure provision, and development contribution. Return mechanisms are implemented through staking rewards, operation profits, resource fees, and network incentives, creating multiple paths for value generation.

## Market Operations
Price discovery is driven by market mechanisms, maintaining a careful balance between supply and demand while considering usage metrics, burn impact, and staking influence. Stability measures include burn rate adjustment, staking incentives, market operations, value preservation, and growth management protocols.

## Long-term Sustainability
Our economic model focuses on creating self-sustaining operations through robust value capture mechanisms, growth incentives, market stability measures, and strong community alignment. Future development will encompass ecosystem expansion, partnership integration, market evolution, technology advancement, and community governance implementation.

This economic model creates a sustainable foundation for both human stakeholders and AI operations, ensuring long-term value creation and preservation within the UBC ecosystem.
